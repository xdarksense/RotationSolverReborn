/// <summary>
/// Effective animation lock reduction tweak (a-la xivalex/noclippy).
/// The game handles instants and casted actions differently:
/// * instants: on action request (e.g. on the frame the action button is pressed), animation lock is set to 0.5 (or 0.35 for some specific actions); it then ticks down every frame
///   some time later (ping + server latency, typically 50-100ms if ping is good), we receive action effect packet - the packet contains action's animation lock (typically 0.6)
///   the game then updates animation lock (now equal to 0.5 minus time since request) to the packet data
///   so the 'effective' animation lock between action request and animation lock end is equal to action's animation lock + delay between request and response
///   this tweak reduces effective animation lock by either removing extra delay completely or clamping it to specified min/max values
/// * casts: on action request animation lock is not set (remains equal to 0), remaining cast time is set to action's cast time; remaining cast time then ticks down every frame
///   some time later (cast time minus approximately 0.5s, aka slidecast window), we receive action effect packet - the packet contains action's animation lock (typically 0.1)
///   the game then updates animation lock (still 0) to the packet data - however, since animation lock isn't ticking down while cast is in progress, there is no extra delay
///   this tweak does nothing for casts, since they already work correctly
/// The tweak also allows predicting the delay based on history (using exponential average).
